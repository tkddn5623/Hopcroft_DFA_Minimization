# Hopcroft_DFA_Minimization
This is C implementation of [Hopcroft DFA minimization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DFA_minimization#Hopcroft's_algorithm).

I implemented this to solve the problem L of [NEERC 2007](https://neerc.ifmo.ru/archive/2007.html) "Language Recognition" ([baekjoon online judge](https://www.acmicpc.net/problem/3593))

Below are the references to implement this code:
